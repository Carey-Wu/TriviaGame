# TriviaGame

The purpose of this project is to use Javascript and JQuery in combination to manipulate HTML elements while incorporating timers.

### Getting Started

First thing you need to do is build the HTML to display everything.  Linking Bootstrap and utilziing 2 containers with multiple divs to house the individual elements should suffice.

Once you have the basic framework set up, you can begin coding your Javascript.

### Javascript

It's always helpful to state and/or define as many variables as you can in the beginning when writing your Javascript.  For this project, it is essentially a quiz consisting of questions and answers.   All those questions and answers can be organized in an array, with each question and answer pairing being an indivdual object within the array.  You can add other keys to each object as well to consolidate data and variables in a more central location.

Once you have stated and/or defined the variables you plan to use, you can begin writing functions to execute your code.

In this exercise the first thing on the screen is a start button.  Write a function to have an event listener for when you click that button that it begins the game and hides the button.

Next write a function for your timers as they are the first thing at the top of the next page.

Then write a function to populate the question and potential answers to the page making them clickable items (Hint: a for loop and .append will useful).

Next write a function to find that finds the index value assigned to answers as they are clicked on so you can reference the data to compare it against the correct answer.  Index values are easy ways to reference data within arrays.

The next function you should make should involve conditionals ( if/else statements) that can be used to compare specific criteria and return appropriate values and/or responses.  Here is where you can incorporate timer and timeout intervals to advance through the questions without physically manipulating any of the html elements.

Once your code runs through all the questions, you should have another function to display all the results.

###  CSS

CSS is really up to you to make things look like you would like them to look.  It's all personal opinion and preferences here.
